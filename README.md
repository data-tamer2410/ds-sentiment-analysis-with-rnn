# Sentiment Analysis with RNN
Discover the power of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sentiment analysisâ€”transforming movie reviews into insightful predictions!

## Description
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) provide a robust framework for analyzing sequential data like text. In this project, we delve into the IMDB movie reviews dataset to build and compare various RNN-based architectures, including standard RNNs, LSTMs, Bidirectional RNNs (BRNNs), and Deep BRNNs. The models are trained to classify reviews as positive or negative, achieving high accuracy levels, with the BRNN LSTM yielding the best performance at 89.53%.
By leveraging these models, the project demonstrates how advanced deep learning techniques can uncover patterns in textual data, offering a scalable solution for sentiment analysis across various domains.
